    content: "I've had the pleasure of knowing Nathalia for about a year now, during which I served as one of the instructors for her five-month internship at Compass.UOL. In my role, I was responsible for observing her technical and interpersonal skills, of which Nathalia consistently impressed me with her show of a clear understanding of development principles, while effectively communicating her progress. Her work always stood out to me and the rest of the team, earning our recognition. That said, her skills in communication and leadership are only matched by her drive to successfully deliver results, whilst improving her existing knowledge and learning from any mistakes listed in the feedbacks we provided. Her projects were some of the best I've seen. She is an avid learner and very persistent, consistently showing a very sharp skill when it comes to problem-solving. On a personal level, I can't help but to emphasize how much of an empathetic, approachable, and collaborative team member she is. Always offering support to her peers and stepping up whenever someone encountered obstacles. Features that left a lasting impression on our team. To be her mentor was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my almost 2 years as an instructor and I wholeheartedly recommend her to any organization or role where a dedicated, talented, and thoughtful professional is needed."
